# Performance baselines

Server benches live in `server/test/*.bench.ts` and run with vitest's built-in
benchmark mode. No extra dependency.

```sh
npm run bench -w server              # every server bench
npm run bench -w server -- evaluate  # evaluate.bench.ts only
npm run bench -w server -- payload   # payload.bench.ts only
npm run bench -w server -- importMesh # importMesh.bench.ts only
npm run bench -w server -- stepImport # stepImport.bench.ts only
```

Each run prints one line per bench with its sample count, median and p95, and
writes the vitest JSON report, raw samples included, to
`server/dist/bench.json`. Vitest 5 has no `--outputJson` flag; the script uses
the JSON reporter with `--outputFile.json` instead. `dist/` is ignored by git
and not copied into the image.

## Method

- Samples: 2 warm-up runs, then exactly 10 measured runs (`warmupIterations`
  2, `iterations` 10, both time floors 0), unless a baseline row names
  another plan. Tinybench also makes one untimed probe call first, except in
  benches registered with `async: false`.
- Median is tinybench's p50. p95 is the nearest-rank p95 of the 10 retained
  samples, so with 10 samples it equals the slowest one.
- The kernel loads once before the benches. Its start-up is not measured.
- A budget is declared before the figure it judges. The bench does not
  enforce budgets; a reader compares the figures against them.
- Figures compare only within one hardware class and runtime. The runtime
  column names the Node that ran the bench, on the host or in the image.

## Hardware classes

Class labels are anonymous. The mapping from a label to a machine stays outside
this repository.

- `class-a`: x86-64 Linux desktop, AMD Ryzen 9 5900X, 12 cores and 24
  threads.

Caveat on the `class-a` figures below: other agents ran builds and tests on the
same machine during every run, with a load average of 20 to 25. The slowest cold
median was 1.8 times the fastest. Treat these figures as a noisy upper bound, and repeat
on a quiet machine before tightening a budget.

## Fixtures

`golden` is built in `evaluate.bench.ts` from the `featureGolden.test.ts`
building blocks: the 20 x 30 x 10 mm base box (sketch `boxSk` and extrude
`box`), a 1 mm shell open at the top face, and a mirror across YZ combined into
the box. Four features, one body. The bench checks that every feature
evaluates `ok` before timing.

- `evaluate cold golden`: a fresh engine per sample, so every feature and the
  tessellation run from scratch.
- `evaluate warm golden`: a no-op re-evaluation of the same document on an
  engine that has already evaluated it, so every snapshot and tessellation is
  a cache hit.

`server/test/helpers/perfFixtures.ts` builds two larger documents with fixed
ids, so every call returns the same document. `perfFixtures.test.ts` runs
under `npm test` and proves both evaluate with no error status.

- `many-feature` is `manyFeaturePart(n)`, default `n` 100: a base block of
  10 mm pitch cells, 100 x 100 x 10 mm for `n` 100, then per cell a 4 x 4 mm
  sketch on XY, a 5 mm pocket cut into the block, and a 0.5 mm fillet on the
  pocket's four vertical edges. 302 features, one body.
- `many-body` is `manyBodyPart()`: a 10 x 10 x 5 mm box with 1 mm fillets on
  its vertical edges, patterned 25 times along X, then all 25 bodies 40 times
  along Y, 15 mm apart and not combined. Five features, 1,000 bodies.
- `fillet-drag` is `filletDragPart()`: `many-body` plus a 0.5 mm fillet on
  one top edge of one pattern copy, `b:py:b:px:b:box:12:8`. Six features,
  1,000 bodies.
- `push-pull` is `pushPullPart()`: `many-body` plus a 10 mm join extrude of
  the top face of that same copy. Six features, 1,000 bodies.
  `pushPull.test.ts` evaluates it in a child process, so a kernel call that
  never returns fails at the timeout instead of hanging the run.

Benches over them:

- `evaluate cold many-feature`: a fresh engine per sample. The engine of the
  last sample stays warm for the next three benches.
- `evaluate noop many-feature`: the same document again, all cache hits.
- `evaluate edit-tail`: alternates the last fillet's radius between 0.5 and
  0.6 mm, so each sample re-evaluates one feature and re-tessellates the body.
- `evaluate edit-head`: alternates the base extrude's distance between 10 and
  11 mm, so each sample regenerates 301 features.
- `evaluate cold many-body`: a fresh engine per sample.
- `payload bytes many-body`: `JSON.stringify` of the cold many-body
  `EvaluateResult`. The bench prints the byte length; the median column holds
  bytes, the stringify time is printed with it.

The two many-feature full regenerations run 0 warm-up and 2 samples. Shapes
are never freed yet (see Memory soak, Destructors), and one full
many-feature regeneration grows the kernel heap by about 700 MB, forced GC included. The
heap caps at 4 GB, so 12 regenerations in one process would abort. PERF-006
could not change that, since the kernel binding frees almost nothing. For the same reason `evaluate cold many-body`,
which grows the heap by about 100 MB per sample, lives in `payload.bench.ts`,
so it runs in its own worker.

`importMesh.bench.ts` imports UV spheres of radius 10 mm from
`server/test/helpers/meshFixtures.ts`, written as binary STL and stored base64
in one `importMesh` feature.

- `mesh-10k`: 100 slices by 51 rings, 10,000 triangles and 5,002 nodes.
- `mesh-100k`: 500 slices by 101 rings, 100,000 triangles and 50,002 nodes.
- `import mesh 10k` and `import mesh 100k`: a fresh engine evaluates the
  document per sample, which is the work an import request waits for: read,
  sew, solid, face names and tessellation. The 100k bench runs 0 warm-up and
  2 samples. One profile of a 10k import took 1.8 s to read and sew, 1.2 s to
  name faces and 4.4 s to tessellate 10,000 faces and 15,000 edges.

`stepImport.bench.ts` imports `largeStepFixture(355)` from
`server/test/helpers/stepFixture.ts`: 355 boxes of 10 mm with a 1 mm fillet
on all 12 edges, 15 mm apart in a 19 by 19 grid, each transferred through
`STEPControl_Writer` as its own root. The STEP text is 24,975,842 bytes. The
first build added about 160 s to a run under load, so the text is cached in
the OS temp directory, keyed by the box count and a content version.

- `import large STEP`: what the import route does after its size checks.
  `readImport` reads the file once to validate it, then a fresh engine
  evaluates the one-feature document, reading it again and tessellating
  355 bodies. 0 warm-up and 2 samples.
- `evaluate noop large STEP`: the same document again on the engine of the
  last import sample.

The PERF-003 no-op figures below predate PERF-034. The tessellation cache
then held 64 bodies and evicted in insertion order, so with 355 bodies every
lookup missed and each no-op re-tessellated every body. PERF-034 bounds the
cache by bytes instead; see Edits on many-body.

## Baselines

PERF-001 ranges span seven runs of `npm run bench -w server -- evaluate` on
2026-09-23. PERF-002 ranges span two runs of each file on its own, `-- evaluate`
then `-- payload`, on 2026-09-23 with a load average of 12 to 30 from other
agents. EXCH-019 ranges span two runs of `-- importMesh` on 2026-09-23 with a
load average of 8 to 18. PERF-003 ranges span three runs of `-- stepImport` on
2026-09-23 with a load average of 13 to 40. Run the files one at a time when recording a baseline, because
`npm run bench -w server` runs every file at once.

PERF-025 made the viewport deflection scale with the body. Its rows span two
runs of `-- payload` on 2026-09-23 with a load average of 13 to 24, alternated
with two runs of the previous code, which gave cold many-body medians of 9.34
and 10.02 s and p95 of 18.0 and 19.5 s. The 10 x 10 x 5 mm bodies now mesh at
0.0075 mm instead of 0.08 mm, so the payload grew 7.1 percent, past its
25,000,000 byte budget.

`evaluate noop large STEP` misses its budget by three orders of magnitude,
for the tessellation cache reason above. The three runs gave p95 of 5.04,
17.6 and 26.2 s.

The last test in `evaluate.bench.ts` fails when a row of this table misses a
column or leaves a cell empty. It runs with the benches, not with `npm test`.

The payload size moves by a byte with the digit count of `kernelMs`. Its
`JSON.stringify` took a median of 107 to 122 ms. Regeneration grows faster than
the feature count: one probe of `manyFeaturePart(25)` took 10 s cold, so 4
times the pockets costs about 14 times the time.

## Edits on many-body

PERF-034 measured what an edit costs on the `many-body` fixture, on
`class-a`, Node 24.12.0, load average 12 to 34. Route figures are one HTTP
call each over loopback through `createApp`, from request to last byte: three
calls per route, one for the last two rows.

Before, a no-op evaluation took 5.26 s. Feature evaluation was all cache hits
and cost nothing, `shapeHash` took 0.3 ms for 1,000 bodies, and
re-tessellating 1,000 bodies took 4.87 s: the 64-entry cache missed every
body. `JSON.stringify` of the 25.4 MB result took 127 to 141 ms, and
`JSON.parse` 59 to 74 ms in Node. On the client, `syncBodies` rebuilt all
1,000 bodies after every evaluation, because a parsed payload is never the
same object.

| call                    | before      | after                         |
| ----------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| engine no-op evaluate   | 5.26 s      | 1 to 2 ms                     |
| `GET evaluate`          | 5.1 to 25 s | 179 to 276 ms                 |
| `GET evaluate`, gzip    | 5.5 to 14 s | 230 to 336 ms, 3.4 MB on wire |
| `PUT groups`            | 5.4 to 13 s | 170 to 260 ms                 |
| body rename             | 9.9 to 15 s | 176 to 241 ms                 |
| body visibility         | 6.9 to 12 s | 207 to 248 ms                 |
| add a sketch at the end | 5.2 s       | 179 to 188 ms                 |
| pattern count 40 to 41  | 9.8 s       | 9.7 to 10.1 s                 |

The before figures grow between calls because every tessellation leaks
kernel memory (see Destructors). After PERF-034:

- The tessellation cache is least recently used and bounded at 256 MB per
  engine, counting 8 bytes per number in the mesh arrays and edge polylines.
  The fixture's 1,000 bodies count 17.4 MB. The key is the body id and shape
  hash; name and visibility are applied per response, so a rename re-meshes
  nothing.
- A JSON response of 64 KiB or more is gzipped at level 1 when the request
  accepts gzip: 25.4 MB becomes 3.4 MB for 88 ms of compression. Level 6
  gives 1.75 MB for 207 ms.
- Each body carries `meshKey`, a SHA-256 of its mesh JSON without name or
  visibility, and `syncBodies` keeps a body's objects while the key holds.
  Hashing adds about 0.2 s to the 10 s cold evaluation. PERF-021's
  `mesh.hash` replaces it.

A change upstream of the pattern still makes every body a new shape, so it
re-evaluates the pattern. Since PERF-035 it meshes only the changed source
bodies and moves the copies. Since PERF-041 a mutation response omits the
meshes the client holds (see Fillet drag on many-body).

PERF-035: `evalLinearPattern` records on each uncombined copy its source body,
offset and name prefix `p{i}:{featureId}`. When the source's mesh is cached,
the engine moves its positions, edge polylines, vertices, bbox and the plane,
cylinder, line and circle anchors by the offset, keeps normals and indices,
and prefixes each face name, and each face name inside edge and vertex names.
The copy's `meshKey` hashes the source key, offset and prefix. A copy meshes
as before when its source is not cached, or the source holds an unnamed or
repeated face name, or a face name holding `|`, `[` or `]`, or named `seam`.
Circular patterns, mirrors and moves still mesh each copy, because rotation
or reflection can reorder the centroid tie-breaks in naming.

Engine time of the pattern count edit: `engine.evaluate` on `many-body` after
one cold evaluation, alternating the Y count between 41 and 40, three edits
each way, no warm-up, on `class-a`, Node 24.12.0. Load average was 22 to 24
before and 9 to 20 after. The audit below measured 9.4 to 10.7 s for 40 to 41.

| call             | before                        | after                        |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| edit 40 to 41    | median 9.94 s, 9.63 to 13.1 s | median 936 ms, 930 to 950 ms |
| edit 41 to 40    | median 10.0 s, 9.26 to 23.3 s | median 902 ms, 898 to 925 ms |
| cold, one sample | 25.8 s                        | 1.26 s                       |

What remains is feature evaluation. A cold evaluation now meshes one body
instead of 1,000, so the `evaluate cold many-body` and payload rows under
Baselines predate PERF-035.

## Fillet drag on many-body

Mark on 2026-09-23: "i foresee there being issues dragging a feature such as
a fillet on a single item in a 1000 item clone like our stress test".
`server/test/filletDrag.bench.ts` changes the `fillet-drag` fillet radius to
a new value per sample, first on the engine alone, then as
`PUT /api/projects/:id/features/drag` through `createApp` over loopback with
`Accept-Encoding: gzip`, timed from request to last byte. It then times
`JSON.parse` of the response text, standing in for the client, and
`JSON.stringify` of the parsed result, standing in for the server. The
`held` variant sends the 1,000 `meshKey`s of the evaluation before the drag.

Ranges span six runs on 2026-09-23, `class-a`, Node 24.12.0, load average 10
to 22: one of the code before PERF-041 and five after it, whose plain
requests take the unchanged path. The last two ran on DOC-010, whose
`revision` adds 17 bytes. The one-body change meshes one body; the other
999 hit the tessellation cache.

| per drag update                | before                         | after                    |

| on the wire, gzip level 1      | 3,388,378 to 3,388,398 bytes   | 79,318 to 79,346 bytes   |
| server `JSON.stringify`        | median 104 to 120 ms           | median 0.79 to 1.2 ms    |
| request to last byte           | median 406 to 469 ms           | median 68 to 77 ms       |
| client `JSON.parse`            | median 68 to 78 ms             | median 0.86 to 0.97 ms   |
| end to end, request plus parse | about 475 to 550 ms            | about 69 to 78 ms        |

The payload dominated: stringify, gzip, transfer and parse took about 420 ms
of every update, the engine 58 to 123 ms. Now the engine takes most of what
is left. `client/src/api.ts` parsed and refilled a 1,000-body response with
999 held bodies in a median 1.1 ms in Node, from one probe of 10 samples.

The budgets come from a drag that updates at least five times a second:
200 ms a request, 100 ms of it engine, and a frame for each parse or
stringify. The plain rows miss them and the held rows meet them. The engine
missed its median in the one run at load average 22.

The client sends `held`, the `meshKey`s it holds, with every JSON mutation. The server answers a body whose key is held with its
id, name, visibility and key only; `meshKey` hashes the whole mesh, so the key
names the arrays exactly. `api.ts` refills those bodies from the map it sent
with the request, not the newest one, so a reply that lands after a newer one
still refills. It keeps one map, replaced by each mutation response and each
`GET evaluate` of the whole timeline, so it holds the current evaluation plus
any request in flight. A timeline peek or a preview base at an earlier
position leaves it alone. The arrays are the same objects the store already
holds. `held` travels in the body of the same `If-Match` edit (DOC-010); a 409
or 428 carries no evaluation and leaves the map as it was. An older client
sends nothing and gets every body in full. PERF-024 replaces this when meshes
leave the JSON; `held` goes with it.

## Audit of 2026-09-23

Mark asked for the recent fixes to reach every place with the same shape:
render on demand, a dwell before previews, a byte-bounded cache keyed by
content, gzip, a content key per client object, and one input per frame.
Figures come from throwaway probes on `class-a`, Node 24.12.0, happy-dom
20.14.5 for client code, load average 7 to 28: the server fixtures, the
client bench fixtures, and `ViewportView` mounted on the fake renderer.
Rows are ordered by measured benefit.

sends several moves a frame, PERF-029's one hover pick per frame covers it.

## Client benches

`client/test/viewport.bench.ts` and `client/test/tree.bench.ts` run with
`npm run bench:client`, in the `dom` project only, so happy-dom provides the
document. `vitest.config.ts` gives the `node` and `browser` projects no bench
files. Method, sample plan and printed lines match the server benches. No JSON
report is written.

The viewport is a real `CadViewport` in a 1280 by 800 pixel container.
`client/test/helpers/fakeRenderer.ts` replaces `THREE.WebGLRenderer`: it
draws nothing, and its `render` only updates world matrices. The figures are
CPU time in Node for scene building, raycasts and bookkeeping. They say
nothing about frame time, GPU memory or draw cost. Real-browser WebGL evidence
at a stated viewport and workload is separate, and no texture-scale claim
rests on these benches.

`client/test/helpers/perfFixtures.ts` builds the inputs:

- `manyBodyPayloads()`: 1,000 synthetic `BodyPayload`s in a 25 by 40 grid,
  15 mm apart. Each is a 10 x 10 x 5 mm box, every side a 13 by 13 grid of
  quads: 2,028 triangles, 6 faces, 12 edges of 14 points, 8 vertices.
- `squareSketch()`: 250 squares of 6 mm at a 10 mm pitch on XY, 1,000 points
  and 1,000 lines, drawn as the active sketch with profiles on and no
  precomputed profiles, as `ViewportView.tsx` passes the draft.
- `imageScene(id)`: 50 reference images of 4096 by 4096 pixels on XY. The
  bench stubs `THREE.ImageLoader` to hand back an unloaded `img` of that size
  once the sync returns, so no pixels exist.

Benches:

- `sync bodies many-body`: `syncBodies` with new payload objects and new
  mesh keys each sample, so all 1,000 bodies are disposed and rebuilt.
- `sync bodies unchanged many-body`: `syncBodies` with new payload objects
  and the same mesh keys, as after an edit that changes no mesh.
- `pick hover many-body`: a hover pick for faces, edges and vertices at the
  canvas centre after `zoomToFit`. The bench checks it hits.
- `highlight face many-body`: `clearHighlights` then a hover `addHighlight`,
  alternating between two faces of one body.
- `sketch hover 2000 entities`: from the top view, zoomed to half the fit, a
  sketch-entity pick alternating between two lines, the `renderSketches`
  rebuild with that hover, then `render`. The bench checks each pick hovers
  the intended line.
- `texture scene bytes`: `syncReferenceImages` for a new document id, so all
  50 textures are new, then the fake loads settle and the previous 50 are
  evicted. The printed byte count is the RGBA8 size of every texture the scene
  holds, with the full mip chain, as `TextureLoader` textures generate
  mipmaps. The median column holds bytes; the sync time is in the text.
- `preview tints many-body`: `previewTints` for the many-body payloads
  against a JSON round trip of the same bodies, as after a live preview
  that changes no mesh.
- `sketch rerender 2000 entities`: `renderSketches` for the square sketch as
  an inactive evaluated sketch with its profiles shown, alternating between
  two JSON round trips of it, as after an evaluation that changes no sketch.
- `sketch rerender 50 sketches`: the same for 50 sketches of four squares,
  32 entities each.
- `tree rerender many-body`: `ModelTree` with the many-body payloads, then a
  new evaluation of copies of the same bodies each sample.
- `tree select many-body`: the same tree, selecting one of two bodies in
  turn.

### Client baselines

Ranges span five runs of `npm run bench:client` on 2026-09-23 with a one-minute
load average of 17 to 22 from other agents. The PERF-034 row spans three runs
on 2026-09-23 at a load average of 38 to 42. The PERF-037 rows span three runs
on 2026-09-23 at a load average of 22 to 24, interleaved with three runs of the
tree before PERF-037: 18.6 to 20.1 ms a new evaluation and 14.3 to 14.9 ms a
selection. The PERF-038 row spans three runs on 2026-09-23 at a load average
of 18 to 20, after three runs comparing mesh arrays: a median of 20.4 to
20.7 ms, p95 21.6 to 22.7 ms. The PERF-039 rows span three runs on
2026-09-23 at a load average of 15 to 19, interleaved with three runs
rebuilding every sketch: a median of 10.3 to 12.6 ms for 2,000 entities and
6.9 to 8.4 ms for 50 sketches.

`sketch hover 2000 entities` misses its budget. Every hover rebuilds all 2,250
sketch objects and reruns `detectProfiles`; PERF-032 owns that. The texture
budget is one mip chain per image, so any texture kept past eviction shows as
a larger figure. The texture sync took a median of 1.46 to 1.69 ms, p95 1.79
to 7.24 ms. The pick hover median is under DEC-202's 4 ms.

## Memory soak

`server/test/memorySoak.test.ts` sits in its own `soak` vitest project, so
`npm test` and `npm run check` skip it. The default 300 cycles take about 6
minutes.

```sh
npm test -w server -- memorySoak
ROCKETT_SOAK_CYCLES=1000 npm test -w server -- memorySoak
```

It evaluates `manyFeaturePart(25)` cold, then runs three phases of the same
cycle count on one engine:

- `edit-tail`: alternates the last fillet's radius between 0.6 and 0.5 mm,
  as the bench does, so each cycle regenerates one feature and tessellates
  the new body.
- `rewind`: evaluates 3 features before the end, then at the end, as the
  timeline's temporary rewind does.
- `tessellate`: calls `tessellateBody` on the unchanged tip body. The body
  already carries its triangulation, so this is tessellation with no new
  mesh.

At cycle 0, every 100 cycles, the last cycle and after `dropEngine`, it
forces GC twice (`--expose-gc` is set at runtime) and prints one `memory soak`
JSON line: RSS, V8 heap used, WASM heap size, handle counts and the one-minute
load average. The WASM heap never shrinks, so its size is the high-water mark,
and use under the initial 100 MB does not show. The test asserts that the
samples exist and are finite, and that live handles grow by under 500 a cycle
from cycle 100 to the last in each phase (PERF-006).

Handle counts come from wrapping every Embind class constructor, static
function and method at start-up. A returned class handle is live until its
`.delete()`. A live handle whose JS wrapper has been collected is orphaned:
nothing can free its C++ object any more. `finalizedHandles` counts handles
Embind's own finalizer freed. `.get()` on an OCCT handle returns a non-owning
pointer that counts too, so the count is an upper bound.

The soak uses 25 pockets because 100 cannot finish 300 cycles: edit-tail at
`manyFeaturePart(100)` grows the heap 17.3 MB a cycle and would pass the 4 GB
cap near cycle 190.

### Curve

One run on 2026-09-23, `class-a`, Node 24.12.0, `manyFeaturePart(25)` (77
features, one body), 300 cycles a phase, 6 min 14 s. Load average 31.4 at the
start and 20.7 to 44.4 at the samples. Reachable is live minus orphaned.

`finalizedHandles` stayed 0 throughout. Growth per cycle:

The WASM heap grows in steps, so single windows read 3.85 and 4.81 MB for
edit-tail and 0.97 to 1.92 MB for tessellate. The JS heap rose 76 MB while the
tessellation cache filled to 64 entries, then stayed flat.

One probe with the same code at `manyFeaturePart(100)` (302 features), load
average 25.7 to 34.9: the cold build took 193 s, took the WASM heap from 100
to 805 MB and left 1,227,792 live handles, 201 of them reachable. After 100
edit-tail cycles the heap was 2,537 MB, RSS 4,714 MB and live handles
10,656,592: 94,288 handles and 17.3 MB a cycle. The 64 cached payloads held
277 MB of JS heap, 4.4 MB each. The run then failed with `Unknown Error: 24`,
a thrown kernel exception, after 1,122 s and before cycle 200.

### Findings

- The kernel frees nothing. No handle was finalized out of 13 million.
  Embind's `attachFinalizer` registers a handle only when `$$.smartPtr` is
  set, and opencascade.js binds OCCT handles as value classes (`Handle_*`), so
  no class handle has one. Forced GC collects JS wrappers only.
- The engine cache is not what holds the handles. At the end 51 of 12,956,033
  live handles were reachable; the rest were orphaned. The snapshots hold the
  body and sketch shapes, and `engine.ts:67` (`this.snapshots.length =
valid`), `invalidate()` and `dropEngine` drop them without `.delete()`. That
  is one body a cycle in edit-tail: few handles, but the whole B-rep and its
  triangulation. `dropEngine` deleted no handle; its 51 reachable handles
  turned orphaned.
- Transient handles leak on every path. Tessellation alone leaves 19,017 of
  the 23,788 a cycle. `explore()` in `kernel.ts` never deletes `ex.Current()`,
  and `faces()`, `edges()`, `vertices()` and `solids()` add a second copy per
  subshape that callers rarely delete. `surfaceInfo` and `curveInfo` in
  `tessellate.ts` leave the `gp_Pln` or `gp_Cylinder`, `gp_Ax1`, `gp_Pnt` and
  `gp_Dir` of each face and circular edge, hence equal `gp_Pnt` and `gp_Dir`
  counts. `listToArray` leaves each `First_1()` copy, and `computeEdgeNames`
  and `computeVertexNames` leave every `FindKey` and `FindFromIndex` copy.
- Each undeleted `TopoDS_Shape` holds a reference on its TShape, so these
  handles keep old faces and edges alive after their body goes. Deleting the
  engine's body shapes alone will not return the geometry.
- Bytes per edit-tail cycle at 25 pockets: tessellating an unchanged body
  costs 1.29 MB of the 4.33 MB. The other 3.0 MB is the fillet result, its
  new faces and their triangulation, plus naming. This split is inferred from
  two phases; the module exports no `mallinfo`.
- The 64-entry tessellation cache is bounded JS memory and holds no handles:
  76 MB at 25 pockets, 277 MB at 100. `dropEngine` returned 65 MB of it.
- A rewind costs one tessellation of an uncached body, then nothing.
- RSS outgrows the WASM and JS heaps: 3,302 MB at the end against 1,865 plus
  330 MB. The remainder is not attributed.

### Destructors

PERF-006 deleted every shape its snapshots drop and every short-lived handle
on the soak paths, and the heap kept growing. The kernel binding cannot free
most objects. Run on 2026-09-23, `class-a`, Node 24.12.0, same fixture and
cycles, load average 10.7 to 37.3:

| phase      | before: handles a cycle | after: handles a cycle | before: WASM heap, cycle 100 to 300 | after: WASM heap, cycle 100 to 300 |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| cold       | 96,267 in all           | 1,474 in all           | 100 MB                              | 100 MB                             |
| edit-tail  | 23,788                  | 232                    | 613 to 1,479 MB                     | 516 to 1,383 MB                    |
| rewind     | 0                       | 0                      | 1,479 MB, flat                      | 1,383 MB, flat                     |
| tessellate | 19,017                  | 231                    | 1,576 to 1,865 MB                   | 1,479 to 1,672 MB                  |

The handles left each cycle are 231 `Poly_Triangulation` pointers from
`.get()`, which own nothing, plus one `Message_ProgressRange` in edit-tail. Heap growth barely
moved: 4.3 MB an edit-tail cycle and about 1 MB a tessellation.

The cause is in `opencascade.js` 2.0.0-beta.b5ff984. A class bound under its
own name, such as `TopoDS_Shape`, `gp_Pnt`, `BRepFilletAPI_MakeFillet` or
`BRepCheck_Analyzer`, shares one Embind destructor that frees nothing: a
24-byte block passed to it is not returned to `malloc`. A constructor
overload class such as `gp_Pnt_3` has a working destructor. So `.delete()`
frees what `new X_n(...)` made, and nothing that a kernel call returned or
that a single-constructor class made. Measured bytes per call:

| call                                                         | bytes kept |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| `new gp_Pnt_3()` then `.delete()`                            | 0.5        |
| `p.Transformed(t)` then `.delete()`, or without `.delete()`  | 32         |
| `new TopoDS_Shape()` then `.delete()`                        | 16.6       |
| `new BRepFilletAPI_MakeFillet(box)` then `.delete()`         | 13,429     |
| one-edge fillet of a box, builder deleted                    | 39,711     |
| `BRepCheck_Analyzer` of a box, deleted                       | 59,761     |
| meshed sphere, shape deleted                                 | 329,441    |
| meshed sphere, `Nullify()` then deleted                      | 1,352      |
| edit-tail at 25 pockets, with or without `Nullify` on delete | 4,413,440  |
| `tessellateBody` of an unchanged 25-pocket body              | 1,114,522  |

`Nullify()` frees the geometry behind a returned shape, but the fillet builder
and the validity analyzer are never destroyed, and each holds its result
body, so edit-tail keeps every fillet and its triangulation. Tessellation
keeps 32 bytes for each `gp_Pnt` and `gp_Dir` a node returns. No JavaScript
change bounds the heap. Mark chose on 2026-09-23 to recycle the worker, so
PERF-018 owns the heap bound, and the soak asserts live handles instead: under
500 a cycle from cycle 100 to the last, in every phase.

The tessellation cache key stays the body id and shape hash, and since REF-004
each entry keeps the body shape it meshed: a hit needs that shape undeleted
and `IsSame` as the body's. A hash collision, or a kernel build whose freed
shapes reuse addresses, re-meshes instead of serving a stale body. On
PERF-034's cache every edit-tail cycle adds an entry: 301 entries and 288 MB
more JS heap after 300 cycles, bounded by its 256 MB payload cap.

## Cost table

`npm run cost` prints what each large file and plugin costs, so tidy-up
candidates show without reading the code. It lists every tracked source file
over 500 lines, every package under `modules/`, and any file holding a function
over 80 lines or a benched function. Tests and benches are not source. Under
each entry it lists every function over 40 lines, and every benched one, with
its line count and bench median, else `no bench`.

- Limits: a file over 500 lines or a function over 80 lines is marked `tidy`.
  Function rows show from 40 lines.
- Sizes come from oxlint's `max-lines` and `max-lines-per-function`, counting
  every line. A function oxlint does not name takes the name before it on its
  first line: the variable it is assigned to, or its call such as
  `useEffect()` or `kernelCall("extrude")`.
- Medians are the p50 of each `*/dist/bench.json` and
  `modules/*/dist/bench.json` that exists. A bench task names its function as
  its first word, such as `solveSketch rectangle`, and matches functions in the
  workspace that wrote the file. The table never runs benches; run
  `npm run bench -ws --if-present` first.
- `scripts/cost-baseline.txt` holds every `tidy` file and function with its
  line count; a repeated name in one file takes `#2`, `#3` in file order.
  `npm run lint:cost`, part of `npm run check`, fails when one grows, a new
  one crosses a limit, or one shrinks without the baseline.
  `npm run cost -- --update` rewrites the baseline; a commit that grows an
  entry says why.
