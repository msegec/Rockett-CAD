# REST API

Base path: `/api`. All bodies are JSON unless noted. Types live in
`shared/src/api.ts` and `shared/src/model.ts`.

Every route is declared once in `ROUTES` in `shared/src/routes.ts`. The server
registers each handler from its entry, and the client builds each path with
`pathFor`, which URL-encodes every parameter. The client sends every call
through `request` in `client/src/api.ts`, which turns an error response into
`ApiError` with its `status` and `code`. A body without `error` and `code`
becomes code `internal`.

Route errors return `ApiErrorBody`: `{ "error": string, "code": ApiErrorCode,
"detail"?: string }`. `error` is a message for the user. The code fixes the
status:

| Code                    | Status | Meaning                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `validation`            | 400    | The request, upload or feature is invalid.                |
| `not_found`             | 404    | The project, folder, feature, body or asset is missing.   |
| `too_large`             | 413    | An upload is over its limit.                              |
| `conflict`              | 409    | The request conflicts with current state.                 |
| `precondition_required` | 428    | A document edit arrived without `If-Match`.               |
| `unprocessable`         | 422    | A stored project fails validation.                        |
| `kernel`                | 503    | The geometry kernel cannot serve the request.             |
| `internal`              | 500    | Server fault. The message is generic; the log has detail. |

Mutating endpoints return `{ document, evaluation }`: the updated document
plus a fresh incremental evaluation (bodies with tagged tessellation, feature
statuses, solved sketches with profiles, construction-plane frames). The
server persists on every mutation (autosave).

Each body carries `meshKey`, a SHA-256 of its mesh, faces, edges, vertices
and bbox, without its name or visibility. The client keeps a body's viewport
objects while its key is unchanged. A JSON response of 64 KiB or more is
gzipped when the request accepts gzip.

A mutating request with a JSON body, and `POST /projects/:id/evaluate`, may
carry `held`, the `meshKey`s the client already holds (`HeldMeshes`). A body
whose key is in `held` comes back as `HeldBodyPayload`,
`{ bodyId, name, visible, meshKey }`, with no mesh, faces, edges, vertices or
bbox; every other body comes in full (`WireEvaluateResult`). Without `held`
every body comes in full. A `held` that is not an array of strings is 400
`validation` with detail `/held` or `/held/N`. `client/src/api.ts` sends the
keys of the last mutation response or whole-timeline evaluation it received,
including when it evaluates at an earlier position, and refills each omitted
body from the payloads it held when it sent that request, so its callers get
full `BodyPayload`s. Evaluate is `POST` because 1,000 keys of 64 hex
characters, about 65 KB, exceed Node's 16 KB request header limit in a URL.

`POST /projects/:id/evaluate`, `PUT /projects/:id/features/:fid`, and
`PUT /projects/:id/document` accept an optional `?position=N` for the returned
evaluation. This temporarily evaluates the first N features without moving the
document's saved timeline marker, for sketch editing and undo/redo in a sketch.

`POST /projects/:id/evaluate` never writes the project. A body without saved
display metadata gets the default (its name is the body id) in the response
only; mutating routes save new body metadata.

Requests targeting the same project run sequentially within one API server,
including evaluation. Separate projects have independent queues. Run only one
server process against a data directory; the queues do not lock across
processes.

### Document revisions

The ETag of a project names its document: `document.json` and its
`revision`, which every save raises by one. `GET /projects/:id` and every
document edit answer with `ETag: "<revision>"`, the same value as
`document.revision`. `GET /projects` gives each readable project's `revision`.

The document edits, listed in `DOCUMENT_EDITS` in `shared/src/routes.ts`, are
rename, `PUT /document`, import into a project, and the feature, timeline,
body and group routes. Each needs `If-Match: "<revision>"` with the revision
the caller last received. Inside the project queue the server compares it
with the stored document:

- no header: 428 `precondition_required`, nothing written;
- a header that is not one quoted integer: 400 `validation`;
- a different revision: 409 `conflict` with the stored `revision` in the
  error body, nothing written.

Creating, duplicating, uploading and deleting a project, placing it in a
folder, saving its view state, uploading an image and retaining an export do
not edit the document and take no `If-Match`. `client/src/api.ts` remembers
the highest revision it has received per project and sends it on every
document edit.

## Projects

| Method & path                  | Body                   | Returns                                                                                                                                         |

| `GET /projects/:id`            | none                   | `{ document }`                                                                                                                                  |

| `POST /projects/:id/duplicate` | `{ name? }`            | `{ document }` (assets copied)                                                                                                                  |
| `POST /projects/:id/rename`    | `{ name }`             | `{ document }`                                                                                                                                  |

Every stored project is listed. `status` is `ok`, `invalid` or `tooNew`, and
the last two carry `error`. A `tooNew` project also carries the
`schemaVersion` it was saved with. Loading a project validates it after
migration; an invalid one is 422 naming the first failure.

### Project file

A project travels as one `.rockett` file, JSON of shape
`{ format: "rockett-project", version: 1, document, assets }`. `assets` maps
each sha256 a reference image names in `assetId` or an `importStep` feature
names in `blob` to its bytes in base64, so a file holds only the files the
document references.

`GET /projects/:id/file` returns the file as an attachment named after the
project: an ASCII `filename` plus a UTF-8 `filename*`.

`POST /projects/file` takes multipart field `file`, up to 64 MB, and returns
`{ document }` for a new project with a new id. An older document schema is
migrated as a saved project is on load, then the document is validated as
`PUT /projects/:id/document` validates it. Every asset must be referenced by
the document and decode from base64, and its bytes must hash to its key. An
image asset also passes the image upload rules. Every referenced asset must be
present. A file from before schema 9 may key its images by their old
`<16hex>.<ext>` ids and may hold STEP sources inline; migration hashes both
and rekeys them. Any `visible` flag the file carries, on a body in
`bodyMeta` or on a sketch or reference image, moves to the new project's
`view.json`, whatever the file's schema, so the stored document holds none.
A file with a newer
`version` or `schemaVersion` gets 400 naming both versions. Any failure
returns 400 and creates nothing: a project half made when an asset fails is
removed.

Two optional text fields go with `file`. `folderId` places the new project in
that folder in the same write, as `POST /projects` does; a missing folder is
400 and creates nothing. `temporary` set to `true` makes a temporary project.
Any other `temporary` value is 400, and so is `temporary` with `folderId`.

### Temporary projects

A temporary project is the server copy of a project kept in the browser. It
is an ordinary project directory plus `temporary.json`,
`{ owner, touchedAt }`, with `owner` `null` until accounts own copies. Every
route that works on a project works on it. `GET /projects` leaves it out,
`PUT /projects/:id/folder` answers 400 for it, and `DELETE /projects/:id`
removes it. Any request to `/projects/:id` or a path below it refreshes
`touchedAt`, written at most once a minute. A sweep at startup and every hour
deletes temporary projects untouched for 24 hours; a request after that gets 404. A temporary project is never backed up before a migration.

## Folders

One folder tree is shared by every user. `GET /folders` returns
`{ folders: Folder[], placement }`: each folder is `{ id, name, parentId }`
with `parentId` `null` at the root, and `placement` maps a project id to its
folder id. A project missing from `placement` sits at the root. Folders live
in `folders.json`, apart from the documents, so a move never changes a
document or its `modifiedAt`.

| Method & path              | Body                   | Returns      |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------ |
| `GET /folders`             | none                   | `FolderTree` |
| `POST /folders`            | `{ name, parentId? }`  | `{ folder }` |
| `PATCH /folders/:id`       | `{ name?, parentId? }` | `{ folder }` |
| `DELETE /folders/:id`      | none                   | `{ ok }`     |
| `PUT /projects/:id/folder` | `{ folderId }`         | `{ ok }`     |

A `null` `parentId` or `folderId` means the root. A name is 1 to 200
characters. A `parentId` or `folderId` naming a missing folder is 400, and so
is a move into the folder itself or a folder inside it. An unknown folder in
the path is 404, as is an unknown project. Deleting a folder that holds a
folder or a project is 409 and deletes nothing.

`POST /projects` with a `folderId` creates the project in that folder in one
call. A missing folder is 400 and creates nothing. Deleting a project drops
its placement.

## Model

### STEP, IGES and BREP import

`POST /projects/import-step` creates a project named from the filename.
`POST /projects/:id/import-step` inserts into an existing project's timeline
at the current marker. Both accept multipart field `file` (`.step`/`.stp`,
`.igs`/`.iges`, `.brep`, `.stl`, `.obj` or `.3mf`) and return
`{ document, evaluation }`. The upload streams to `uploads/` while it is
hashed. Two limits apply, each 10 MB by default: the upload limit stops the
transfer with 413 as soon as it is passed, and the import limit returns 413
before the kernel reads a file over it. A STEP, IGES or BREP source moves
from `uploads/` into the blob store once the import succeeds. A
cancelled, oversized or unreadable upload removes its own file in `uploads/`
and keeps no new project. Exact files must contain solid bodies. A file with
none is 400 naming its format, for example `No solid found in the IGES file.`
A mesh over 200,000 triangles is 400 with its count, for example
`The STL mesh has 200,001 triangles; the limit is 200,000.` An open mesh
imports with feature status `warning` and a `warning` message. A 3MF zip entry
that expands past 256 MB is 400. Invalid files are rejected before a new
project is kept. A STEP, IGES or BREP source is stored in the project's blob
store and the feature names its sha256 in `blob`; a mesh source is embedded in
the document, and uploads that take the document beyond 40 MB are rejected.

| Method & path                        | Body                    | Notes                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `POST /projects/:id/evaluate`        | `{ held? }`             | Evaluate to the timeline marker; returns `WireEvaluateResult`                |
| `PUT /projects/:id/document`         | `{ document }`          | Full replace (undo/redo restore); validated; 404 if project no longer exists |
| `POST /projects/:id/features`        | `{ feature }`           | Insert **at the timeline marker**; empty `name` → server assigns `Extrude2`… |
| `PUT /projects/:id/features/:fid`    | `{ feature }` (partial) | Edit parameters/name/suppressed; id immutable                                |
| `DELETE /projects/:id/features/:fid` | none                    | Marker adjusts if needed                                                     |
| `POST /projects/:id/timeline`        | `{ position }`          | Move the rollback marker                                                     |
| `PUT /projects/:id/bodies/:bodyId`   | `{ name?, visible? }`   | Rename a body; `visible` writes `view.json`, as below                        |
| `PUT /projects/:id/groups`           | `{ groups }`            | Replace the model tree groups; never changes evaluation                      |

### View state

`GET /projects/:id/view` returns the project's view state from
`projects/<id>/view.json`:
`{ version: 1, hidden: { bodies: string[], features: string[] } }`. A project
with no saved view returns empty lists. `PUT /projects/:id/view` replaces it
with a body of the same shape and echoes it back. The body is validated, with
unknown fields rejected, and a bad one is 400 with nothing written. The PUT
never edits the document, never evaluates and never raises the revision, so
it takes no `If-Match`; the last write wins. A missing project is 404. The
view stays with the project and is shared by everyone who opens it. Once
`view.json` exists, the GET and PUT touch only that file and never read the
document. A GET on a project saved before schema 11 reports the visibility its
document held. A PUT on a project with no `view.json` first migrates the
document on disk, after its backup. The migration writes the old flags only
into a missing `view.json`, so they cannot return over a saved view.

Visibility lives only in the view. Until DOC-020 the old paths still work
through it: `visible` in a body PUT or a feature patch writes `view.json`, and
a patch with nothing else saves no document and keeps the revision. Responses
report `visible` from the view: on each body, and on each sketch and reference
image in the document. `PUT /projects/:id/document` moves any `visible` it
carries into the view.

## Inspection & output

| Method & path                | Body                                                             | Returns                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `POST /projects/:id/measure` | `{ refs: [FaceRef\|EdgeRef\|VertexRef, …] }` (1–2)               | `MeasureResult` (distance, ΔXYZ, angle, per-item length/area/radius/position)                                                                                             |
| `POST /projects/:id/export`  | `{ format: "stl"\|"3mf", bodyIds: string[], quality?, retain? }` | Binary file (`Content-Disposition` attachment). Empty `bodyIds` = every body the view does not hide. `retain: true` also stores a copy under the project's `exports/` dir |

Export returns 400 when an id in `bodyIds` is not a body of the evaluated
model; the error names the offending ids. `format` is required, and `stl` is
always binary. `quality` is the tessellation tolerance in mm: a number,
default 0.05, clamped to 0.001 to 1.

## Assets (reference images)

| Method & path                       | Body              | Notes                                                 |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `POST /projects/:id/assets`         | multipart `image` | PNG/JPEG/WebP by magic bytes, ≤ 25 MB → `{ assetId }` |
| `GET /projects/:id/assets/:assetId` | none              | Serves the image with its sniffed type                |

`assetId` is the sha256 of the image bytes, and the image lives in the
project's blob store. An id that is not a sha256, or names a blob that is not
an image, is 404.

## Validation

Routes with a JSON body outside the feature and document routes parse it
against the JSON Schema on their `ROUTES` entry in `shared/src/routes.ts`
before the handler runs. A mismatch returns 400 with the failing JSON Pointer
in `detail`, such as `/edge/bodyId`.

`server/src/api/validate.ts` bounds every modelling parameter (finite numbers,
sane ranges, entity/constraint counts) and rejects duplicate feature ids;
project/asset ids are pattern-checked against path traversal. The API exposes
controlled modelling operations only.

A feature must be a plain object with only the top-level keys its type
declares, and `suppressed` must be a boolean. An update patch must also be an
object; its keys are checked against the stored feature's type. The validator
checks profile, face, edge, plane and axis references in depth, every list
item, and each enum and flag (`operation`, extrude `direction`, emboss `mode`,
`combine`, `keepTools`, `visible`).

Every feature is parsed against its type's schema in
`shared/src/schema/features.ts`, which also checks each sketch entity and
constraint shape and requires a non-empty `name`. The declared top-level keys
are that schema's properties. A mismatch returns the JSON Pointer inside the
feature in `detail`, such as `/transform/scale`.

`PUT /projects/:id/document` also parses the document against
`documentSchema` in the same file: `schemaVersion` equals the current version,
`revision` is a non-negative integer, `savedWith` is `null` or
`{ version, commit }` with `commit` a string or `null`,
`units` is `mm`, `cm`, `m` or `in`, `bodyMeta` values are
`{ name: string }`, `counters` are non-negative integers,
`groups` have unique ids, a name of 1 to 200 characters, `kind` `body` or
`sketch`, and no member in two groups,
`extensions` keys match `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*(\.[a-z][a-z0-9-]*)*$` and each
value is `{ version, data }` with `version` a non-negative integer and `data`
any JSON value,
`createdAt` and `modifiedAt` are non-empty strings and `timelinePosition` is an
integer no greater than the feature count. Loading a saved project migrates
it without validating.

Every validation failure returns 400 and nothing is saved.

## WebSockets

Not used. Evaluation is fast enough to return synchronously for single-user
loads; the response envelope (`document + evaluation`) is designed so a future
job/progress channel can slot in without breaking clients.

### POST /api/projects/:id/features/:fid/project

Read-only projection preparation for a sketch. Body: { edge: EdgeRef, entityId: string }.
Returns { entities: SketchEntity[] } with stable generated IDs and source references.
Resolves source geometry before the target sketch; downstream or unsupported
geometry returns 400. Persist the returned entities using the normal feature
update endpoint, which also provides undo/redo integration in the client.

### POST /api/projects/:id/tangent-edges

Read-only chain query: { edge: EdgeRef, beforeFeatureId?: string } returns
{ edges: EdgeRef[] }. An edit supplies beforeFeatureId to resolve its inputs
before the feature. Source errors return 400; no document changes are persisted.
