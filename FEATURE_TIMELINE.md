# Feature timeline

The timeline is the chronological list of parametric features at the bottom of
the workspace. It is the _product_: everything else exists to keep it
editable.

## Semantics

- `document.features` is the ordered history; every modelling operation is a
  feature (`Sketch1`, `Extrude1`, `Fillet1`, …) with a stable id, a display
  name, a `suppressed` flag, parameters, and references to its inputs
  (profiles by sketch+profile id, topology by persistent face/edge names,
  bodies by body id, see CAD_MODEL.md).
- `document.timelinePosition` is the marker: the number of currently active
  features. Features after the marker exist but are **rolled back**: they are
  ghosted in the UI and skipped by the engine.

## Operations

| Action                | Mechanics                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Select / hover        | Chip click; tooltip shows type + any error; resting 0.3 s on a chip shows the model after it without changing the document                     |
| Rename                | Context menu → inline edit (stored on the feature)                                                                                             |
| Edit                  | Double-click or context menu; sketches open the sketch editor, other features open their parameter dialog pre-filled (same dialog as creation) |
| Suppress / unsuppress | Context menu; suppressed features are skipped during evaluation but keep their place in history                                                |
| Delete                | Context menu (no confirm, Ctrl+Z restores)                                                                                                     |
| Roll back / forward   | Click any marker gap, the ⏮◀▶⏭ controls, or drag intent via repeated stepping                                                                  |
| Insert mid-history    | Roll back to the insertion point, then create features normally. New features insert **at the marker**, and the marker advances past them      |

## Rollback contract (the fundamental requirement)

Rolling the marker back to position _k_ shows the model exactly as it existed
after feature _k_. While rolled back you can:

- select faces that exist _at that point in history_,
- sketch on them, dimension, constrain,
- create features, which are inserted at the marker,
- edit earlier features (double-click),
- then return to the end of the timeline.

Later features rebuild against the modified model through their persistent
references. The MVP workflow exercises this end to end: 100×50 plate → hole →
fillet → roll back → widen to 120 → roll forward → hole and fillet regenerate.

## Dependencies and failures

Feature references form the dependency graph implicitly: a feature that
consumes `sketchId`s, `bodyId`s, or persistent face/edge names depends on
whatever produces them. The engine evaluates chronologically, so dependencies
are always evaluated first; an edit invalidates exactly the downstream suffix
(snapshot cache, CAD_MODEL.md → "Regeneration").

Snapshots own the kernel shapes and face name maps in their state. The
kernel never frees a shape by itself, so when snapshots are truncated,
invalidated or their engine is dropped, `releaseSnapshots` in `engine.ts`
deletes every body shape and name map that only discarded snapshots hold. A
shape or map a kept snapshot shares through `cloneState` stays. A failed
feature releases its partial state the same way. Name maps made while a
feature evaluates are released when it ends unless a body in its result holds
them.
A caller that needs a shape after its engine is dropped reads what it needs
first. Short-lived handles, such as explored faces and edges, name lookups
and adaptors, are deleted by the code that made them. Kernel calls share the
one progress range `progress()` returns, which lives as long as the kernel
and which no caller deletes.

If an upstream change removes geometry a downstream feature references, that
feature is marked in the timeline:

> ⚠ Fillet1: referenced edge no longer exists: e[f:…|f:…]

The model is **never silently corrupted**: the failed feature contributes
nothing, the pre-failure state carries forward, and the error text names the
missing reference. Fixing the upstream edit (or editing the failed feature to
re-select) clears the error. A guided "repair reference" flow is on the
roadmap.

## Undo/redo is not the timeline

Undo (Ctrl+Z) restores whole document snapshots. It un-does _your editing
actions_ (created a feature, changed a dimension, renamed, deleted…). The
timeline is part of the document being snapshotted. The two are independent
axes, as in mainstream CAD: undo moves through editing history, the marker
moves through modelling history.
