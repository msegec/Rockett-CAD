# Architecture

The triangle mesh is only a picture. The B-Rep model that OpenCascade builds
from the parametric document is the geometry.

```
Browser UI (React)
   ↓ selection, tool state, dialogs
3D viewport (three.js)
   ↓ REST (JSON; meshes as binary)
Parametric document (shared TypeScript schema)
   ↓
Geometry service (Node.js, regeneration engine + caches)
   ↓
CAD kernel (OpenCascade 8.0.1 compiled to WebAssembly)
   ↓
B-Rep model (TopoDS solids, faces, edges, vertices)
```

## Repository layout

| Path          | Role                                                                                           |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `shared/`     | Document schema, sketch solver, profiles, routes, units. Browser and server run the same code. |
| `server/`     | Express API, project store, kernel worker and geometry layer.                                  |
| `client/`     | React and three.js UI.                                                                         |
| `modules/`    | Optional modules, such as CAM.                                                                 |
| `plugin-api/` | `@rockett/plugin-api`, the only core package a module imports.                                 |
| `docker/`     | Unraid template.                                                                               |

## Key decisions

**Kernel: OpenCascade WASM on the server.** A full B-Rep kernel with no
native build. Geometry lives in `server/src/geometry/`; the API reaches it
only through `KernelClient` (`server/src/kernel/client.ts`).
`WorkerKernel` runs it in one worker thread so health and requests stay
responsive during a long regeneration; `ROCKETT_KERNEL=inprocess` runs it on
the main thread. A module kernel job runs in the same worker from its
`modules/<id>/kernel.ts`, which `server/build.sh` bundles as
`<id>.kernel.mjs` beside `kernel-worker.mjs` (`server/src/modules/host.ts`).
That bundle's `features` export lists the `defineTimelineFeature`
definitions the module's server entry registers through
`register.timelineFeature`; the host installs each type in the worker.
Each spawn replays the installed list, and an install or removal drops warm
results. A feature callback returns one solid; core validates and
names it, and a failure keeps the previous body
(`server/src/modules/features.ts`).
A worker crash quarantines the running feature, blocks its
dependents and exports, and restarts with a bounded backoff:
`server/src/kernel/workerKernel.ts`.

**Server owns the document.** Clients send feature-level edits; the server
validates, evaluates, saves and returns the document with the model. Every
document edit except a project rename goes through `mutateProject` in
`server/src/api/projectMutations.ts`. A stale revision gets 409 and writes
nothing: `server/src/api/revision.ts`. Undo is server history, separate from
the timeline (FEATURE_TIMELINE.md). Hidden items and the camera are
per-user view state, outside the document and undo:
`server/src/store/viewStore.ts`. A browser project keeps its view in its
browser record, and its temporary copy holds it in server memory. API.md owns
the routes, revisions and history contracts.

**Storage.** `server/src/store/` owns persistence. Writes are atomic
(`server/src/store/storage.ts`). A migration backs up the whole project
before its first write (`backupNamespace` in `server/src/store/jsonStore.ts`).
The history log survives a crash mid-save
(`server/src/store/historyStore.ts`).
DOCKER.md owns the disk layout and the backup and restore steps.

**Shared parametric code.** The solver and profile detection run in the
browser while dragging and on the server during regeneration. One
implementation, so they cannot drift.

**Two tiers.** Drag solving, profile highlight and selection stay in the
browser; committed operations run through the kernel. An edit to feature _k_
re-evaluates only _k..end_: `server/src/geometry/engine.ts`. CAD_MODEL.md,
Regeneration engine, has the detail.

**Units.** Stored geometry is millimetres. The `units.length` setting in
`shared/src/settings.ts` owns the display unit; `shared/src/units.ts` owns
conversion and parsing (`shared/test/units.test.ts`).

**Registries.** Feature specs, kinds and UIs, commands and toolbar groups,
hold keys, menu items, panels, workbenches, selection kinds, pick providers,
scene layers, importers, exporters and route modules each register through
`createRegistry` (`shared/src/registry.ts`), and each registration returns a
disposer. Core registers through the same calls a module uses. API.md,
Extension points and Modules, owns the module contract.

**Dialog form kit.** `client/src/components/form/` holds every dialog field
and the one OK and Cancel footer. No other component renders a raw number
input. An empty or partial box never writes 0 or NaN:
`client/src/components/form/fields.tsx`.

## Identity

Middleware order in `server/src/app.ts`: origin check, session, router. A
state-changing request without an allowed `Origin` fails before
authentication (`server/src/auth/origin.ts`). Only health, setup, status and
login pass without a session (`server/src/auth/middleware.ts`). The CAD
router checks project access first (`server/src/api/projectAccess.ts`).

## Security posture

- The API exposes modelling operations only, no command execution.
- `server/src/api/validate.ts` checks every parameter before the kernel.
- Ids are validated on every path access; traversal is refused:
  `storagePath` in `server/src/store/storage.ts`.
- Images are checked by magic bytes and size capped: `imageMime` in
  `server/src/store/projectStore.ts`.
- The container runs as a non-root user and writes only `/data`.
- Passwords are scrypt hashes (`server/src/auth/password.ts`); sessions use
  HttpOnly cookies. Project owners and members decide access.

## Performance

- Regeneration is incremental, cached per feature.
- Engines, tessellations and encoded meshes sit in bounded LRU caches.
  Engines evict by measured bytes against `ENGINE_CACHE` in
  `server/src/tunables.ts`, a share of the host memory limit. Tessellations
  and served meshes hold the `shared/src/meshFormat.ts` binary; served meshes
  evicted from memory spill to a bounded disk store. The memory and disk mesh
  limits are in `server/src/kernel/meshCache.ts`.
- Viewport work never calls the kernel.
- The viewport rebuilds a body's geometry only when its mesh hash changes. A
  body sent without its mesh is fetched by hash, at most 6 at once, aborted
  on a project switch and retried on the next sync:
  `client/src/three/bodyObjects.ts`.
- A body whose bbox diagonal projects under 64 px draws its coarse level when
  it has one, and picks and highlights use the level on screen. Bodies under
  1,024 triangles get no coarse level, and mesh bodies none at all: they are
  the imported triangles.
- Sketch drags solve in the browser; API.md, Evaluation, says when a sketch
  write or evaluation solves.
