# Architecture

Rockett CAD follows the layered architecture the project brief prescribes: the
rendered triangle mesh is only a _visualisation_ of the CAD model. The
authoritative geometry is always the B-Rep model produced by the OpenCascade
kernel from the parametric document.

```
Browser UI (React)
   ↓ selection, tool state, dialogs
3D viewport / interaction layer (three.js)
   ↓ REST (JSON)
Parametric document / model representation (shared TypeScript schema)
   ↓
Geometry service (Node.js, regeneration engine + caches)
   ↓
CAD kernel (OpenCascade 8.0.1 compiled to WebAssembly)
   ↓
B-Rep model (TopoDS solids, faces, edges, vertices)
```

| `shared/` | The document schema (`model.ts`), the sketch constraint solver (`solver.ts`), profile/region detection (`profiles.ts`), API DTOs (`api.ts`), the route table (`routes.ts`), units (`units.ts`), modelling tolerances (`tolerance.ts`) and rigid placements (`placement.ts`). Runs identically in browser and server. |
| `server/` | Express REST API, project store, and the geometry layer: kernel bootstrap, feature evaluators, persistent-naming, regeneration engine, tessellation, exporters, measurement.                                                                                                                                         |
| `client/` | React + three.js UI: viewport, sketcher, timeline, model tree, feature dialogs. `api.ts` sends every call through one `request`; `components/form/` holds the dialog fields and footer; `three/` holds shared disposal, screen projection and the `Manipulator` gizmo base.                                          |

## Key decisions

**Kernel: OpenCascade via WASM, hosted server-side.**
`opencascade.js` (OCCT 8.0.1) runs inside the Node process. This gives a full
B-Rep kernel (booleans, fillets, shells, sweeps, topology interrogation,
history tracking) with zero native build complexity in Docker. The runtime
image is plain `node:24-trixie-slim`. The geometry code is isolated behind
`server/src/geometry/` so it could later move to a worker thread or separate
process without touching the API; for a single-user deployment, in-process
evaluation is simple and fast (typical feature evaluation is a few ms; full
first-load regeneration of a moderate model tens of ms).

**Server owns the document.** Clients send feature-level operations
(`add/edit/delete feature`, `set timeline position`, …); the server validates,
persists (autosave on every mutation) and responds with the updated document
plus a freshly evaluated model. Undo/redo is a client-side stack of document
snapshots restored through a full-document endpoint, deliberately distinct
from the CAD timeline (see FEATURE_TIMELINE.md). What is hidden is view state,
not document: the client keeps it in a `view` slice and saves it with
`PUT /view`, outside undo and evaluation. Every document edit names the
revision it last read, and a stale one gets 409 with nothing written (see
API.md, Document revisions).

**Storage.** `server/src/store/` owns persistence. `Storage` reads, writes
atomically, moves, lists and removes paths under the data root, and
`LocalStorage` is its one implementation. `JsonStore` keeps one namespace of
JSON files, queues writes per key and migrates each file on read through its
`Migrations` table. Before a migrated file is first written, it backs up the
file's whole directory; a temporary project gets no backup. `BlobStore` keeps
a project's source files and images by sha256. `ProjectStore` assembles a
project from its `project.json` manifest (`ManifestStore`), its part
document, `view.json` and blobs. `HistoryStore` keeps a project's undo
history in `history/`: a log of at most 50 labelled entries plus
checkpoints, a cursor, and gzip snapshots of the document named by the sha256
of their stored bytes. A history save writes the document, its snapshot, the
log and the cursor as one transaction: the migration recovery record lists
it, and a failure or restart rolls it back. No route records history yet.
DOCKER.md shows the layout on disk and the backup and restore rules.

**Shared parametric code.** The constraint solver and profile detection are
plain TypeScript used by _both_ sides: the browser solves interactively while
dragging sketch geometry; the server re-solves authoritatively during
regeneration. There is exactly one implementation of each, so they cannot
drift.

**Two-tier interactivity.** Cheap interactive feedback (sketch drag solving,
profile highlighting, selection) happens client-side; committed CAD operations
run through the kernel. The engine caches per-feature snapshots and
tessellations so an edit to feature _k_ re-evaluates only features _k..end_
(see CAD_MODEL.md, "Regeneration").

**Units.** All geometry is internally millimetres. `Units` on the document is
display metadata. `shared/src/units.ts` owns the conversions (`toMm`,
`fromMm`) and length and angle formatting; they never mutate stored geometry.
`LengthField` shows a length in its `units` prop and reports millimetres.
Every dialog passes `mm` today.

**Dialog form kit.** `client/src/components/form/fields.tsx` holds the dialog
inputs: `NumField`, `LengthField`, `AngleField`, `SelectField`, `AxisField`,
`CheckField` and `SelInfo`. `NumField` reports only finite values within its
`min` and `max`, so an empty or partial box never writes 0 or NaN. No other
component renders a raw number input. `DialogFooter.tsx` is the one OK and
Cancel footer. Inside its panel, Enter in an input triggers OK and Escape
triggers Cancel; feature dialogs take Escape from anywhere. A field marked `autoFocus` takes focus with its value
selected when the dialog opens, so typing replaces it.

## Security posture

- The API exposes _controlled modelling operations only_, with no arbitrary
  command execution surface.
- All modelling parameters are validated (`server/src/api/validate.ts`)
  before reaching the kernel; document/feature ids are pattern-checked.
- Project ids are server-generated, asset ids are the sha256 of their bytes,
  and both are regex-validated on every path access (no path traversal).
- Uploaded images are validated by magic bytes (PNG/JPEG/WebP only) and size
  capped.
- The container runs as a non-root user; the only writable path is `/data`.
- Authentication is intentionally separable: the app is single-user behind
  your reverse proxy today. All state flows through `ProjectStore`, so adding
  per-user scoping or an auth middleware (basic auth, OIDC, Cloudflare
  Access header checks) requires no changes to the CAD layers.

## Performance notes

- Regeneration is incremental (feature-snapshot cache keyed by feature JSON).
- The server keeps engines for the 8 most recently used projects. An engine
  keeps the verified bytes of the STEP blobs its document references, so an
  edit reads no blob. Evicting one releases its snapshot shapes and those
  bytes; its next evaluation rebuilds from scratch.
- Tessellations are cached per body id and shape hash, bounded at 256 MB
  across engines; only changed bodies re-mesh. A rename or visibility change
  does not.
- Viewport work (orbit/pan/zoom, hover, drag previews) never invokes the
  kernel.
- Sketch drag solving runs locally in the browser at pointer-move rate; the
  authoritative solve happens once on commit.
