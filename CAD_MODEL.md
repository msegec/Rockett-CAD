# CAD model

The document is a recipe. Geometry is rebuilt from it and never saved. This
file keeps the contracts code cannot show and names the code that owns each.

Parameter shapes live in the types, not here: `CadDocument` in
`shared/src/documents.ts`, one module per feature in `shared/src/features/`, JSON
schemas in `shared/src/schema/`.

## Saved projects

Saved projects are user data. A shape change ships a migration, a backup and
a test that loads the previous schema.

- `SCHEMA_VERSION` in `shared/src/documents.ts` is the document version. A shape
  change bumps it and adds the step from the old version to
  `documentMigrations` in `server/src/store/migrations.ts`.
- `migrate` refuses a newer file with `TooNewError` and a gap with
  `MissingStepError`.
- Load migrates in memory. The first save backs up the complete project
  through `NamespaceBackup` in `server/src/store/jsonStore.ts`, then writes
  one generation.
- Boot lists outdated projects and migrates none: `server/src/index.ts`.
- Loading never writes. `pinRefs` in `server/src/geometry/pinRefs.ts` pins
  `targets` and `sig` in memory only.
- An optional field needs no step when documents saved without it read the
  same, as an `importStep` without `format` reads as STEP:
  `shared/src/features/importStep.ts`.
- The store sets `revision` to the stored value plus one on every write:
  `server/src/store/projectStore.ts`.
- STEP, IGES and BREP bytes live in the project blob store under their
  sha256 (`server/src/store/blobStore.ts`). The feature holds `blob`.
- `extensions` values keep their `{ version, data }` envelope. The server
  never reads `data`.
- A feature is a `CoreFeature` or an `ExtensionFeature`, whose dotted
  `type` names its module and whose own `version` and `params` its
  `FeatureSpec` owns. Load runs the spec's `migrate` through `migrate`, with
  the type as namespace (`documentMigrations.nested`). Core features carry no
  `version` and load unchanged; an unregistered type stays as stored.

### Schema steps

| Step     | Change                                             |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 to 5   | version only: projection, offsets, `lineAngle`     |
| 5 to 6   | `groups: []`                                       |
| 6 to 7   | `revision: 0`, `savedWith: null`                   |
| 7 to 8   | inline STEP `data` becomes a `blob`                |
| 8 to 9   | reference image asset becomes a blob               |
| 9 to 10  | `extensions: {}`                                   |
| 10 to 11 | `visible` moves to the user view, `camera` dropped |
| 11 to 12 | `namingVersion: 1`                                 |
| 12 to 13 | stale `visible` dropped                            |
| 13 to 14 | version only: refs may carry `sig`                 |
| 14 to 15 | version only: tools may carry `targets`            |
| 15 to 16 | version only: revolve `faces`                      |
| 16 to 17 | version only: sketch distances, `lineAngle.axis`   |
| 17 to 18 | version only: construction plane `method` kinds    |
| 18 to 19 | `units` moves to the project settings layer        |
| 19 to 20 | version 2 join `targets` sorted by `compareNames`  |
| 20 to 21 | `modifiedBy: null`                                 |

## Body identity

Owners: `orderBodyPieces` in `server/src/geometry/naming.ts`, `derivedBodyId`
and `compareNames` in `shared/src/topoRefs.ts`.

- A new body is `b:{featureId}`. Extra pieces are `b:{featureId}:2`, and so
  on.
- Join and cut keep the target's id. Bodies one tool bridges keep the first
  id in `targets`, else the first by `compareNames`.
- Split pieces: version 1 orders by volume. Version 2 orders by each piece's
  smallest unshared face name, and a piece with no name of its own fails as
  an identity conflict. The first piece keeps the target's id. Under version
  2 a join, cut or intersect names the rest `b:{featureId}:{n}`, numbered
  from 2 across the feature, so the id never grows with chain depth; version
  1 appends `:{n}` to the target's id.
- Mirror, pattern and Move copies are `b:{featureId}:{n}`, fixed length at
  any depth. The first `splitBody` piece keeps its id.
- A fresh process gives the same ids and names.
- Display names live in `document.bodyMeta`, set once when a body first
  appears: a STEP body takes its instance or product name, made unique with
  ` (2)`, ` (3)`, with control characters removed and capped at 200
  characters; any other body, or a STEP name that is empty or OCCT's default
  `Open CASCADE STEP translator {version} {n}`, takes `BodyN` from
  `counters.body`. Schema 31 adds an optional `bodyMeta` `color`, lowercase
  `#rrggbb`, which wins over a STEP colour in evaluation; an earlier
  document migrates unchanged. Visibility lives in the user
  view; see [API.md](API.md), View state. `document.groups` never reaches
  evaluation.

## Topological naming

Never reference topology by index. `server/src/geometry/naming.ts` owns
names. The document's `namingVersion` picks the rules. New projects get 2;
only the Naming upgrade changes a stored version.

### Face names

| Origin                                      | Name                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Extrude or revolve side from a sketch curve | `f:{featureId}:s:{sketchEntityId}`                      |
| Extrude or revolve cap                      | `f:{featureId}:cap:start`, `f:{featureId}:cap:end`      |
| Sweep and loft side and cap, version 2      | as extrude                                              |
| Fillet or chamfer face from an edge         | `f:{featureId}:fe:{n}`, `f:{featureId}:fe:{n}:{part}`   |
| Press/pull moved face, version 2            | the source face's name                                  |
| Mirror or pattern copy, version 1           | `m:{featureId}:{name}`, `p{i}:{featureId}:{name}`       |
| Mirror or pattern copy, version 2           | `m:{featureId}:{key}{~n}`, `p{i}:{featureId}:{key}{~n}` |
| Move copy                                   | as the pattern copy with `i` 1                          |
| STEP, IGES or BREP import face, version 2   | `f:{featureId}:g:{surface}:{key}`                       |
| Anything the history cannot attribute       | `f:{featureId}:x{n}`                                    |

- Names follow the kernel history (`propagateNames`, `historyNames`).
- Every face name template lives in `server/src/geometry/naming.ts`; a
  fillet or chamfer adds `:{part}` only when one edge makes several faces.
- A name map is a `ShapeMap` (`server/src/geometry/shapeMap.ts`) matched by
  `IsSame`, so hash collisions keep names.
- Duplicates get `~n` in centroid order x, y, z (`suffixDuplicates`).
  Version 2 rounds to `LINEAR_TOL` first and marks equal cells `~?n`.
  Fallback faces in an equal cell become `f:{featureId}:x~?{n}`.
- Version 2 names a face its history missed from the profile edge whose
  midpoint lies on it. A face touched by several takes the first name with
  `~?1`.
- A face reference to a `~?` name never resolves; the resolver reports it.
- Version 2 `key` is the first 16 hex digits of the SHA-256 of the source
  name without its `~n` or `~?n` suffix, so a copy name keeps one length at
  any mirror or pattern depth.
- A face merged by unify takes its inputs' shared base name. Version 1 keeps
  the seams it always had.

### Edge and vertex names

```
e[{faceA}|{faceB}]          edge bounded by two faces (names sorted)
e[{faceA}|seam]             seam edge
v[{faceA}|{faceB}|{faceC}]  vertex named by its adjacent faces, version 1
v[{key}]                    vertex, version 2: key of the sorted face names
```

`computeEdgeNames` and `computeVertexNames` own them. Duplicates take `~n` as
faces do. Stored names are bounded only by the request size.

### Signatures

`server/src/geometry/signature.ts` describes a face or edge as a
`RefSignature` of type, point and direction. Under
version 2, `geometryNames` names import faces from their signature, so two
imports of one file name faces alike. Mesh imports keep
`x{n}` names.

### Resolution

`resolveRefs` in `server/src/geometry/resolve.ts` sorts each reference into
`resolved`, `candidate`, `ambiguous` or `missing`.

- A name its body still bears is `resolved`. Under version 2, a picked `~?n`
  edge also resolves when its stored signature uniquely matches that name.
  Unsigned ties require repair; coincident matches report both edge names.
- Version 2: a name whose `sig` now matches a renumbered sibling is a
  `candidate`, not followed.
- Otherwise lineage decides, then the `sig` on the referenced body. Other
  bodies give `suggestions` only.
- Evaluation never writes a candidate or a `sig`. Only a feature update, the
  repair, changes a stored reference's name.
- Version 2: an unresolved reference fails its feature and blocks later
  features that name its bodies. Other bodies build. Export refuses a
  blocked body.
- Version 1: nothing blocks. Failures still report their references.
- Measurement skips the resolver. It measures the live pick by its exact
  name, a tied `~?` name included, and never repairs or stores it.

### Known limitations

- `~n` order swaps when an upstream edit moves duplicates past each other.
  Version 2 still swaps across a rounding step.
- Split pieces renumber. A signed reference becomes a `candidate`; an
  unsigned one moves silently, as every version 1 one does.
- A save evaluated only up to an open sketch refreshes no `sig` after that
  sketch, and finishing the sketch only evaluates. Those references keep
  their old `sig` until a later save changes a feature before them.
- A failure that is not a reference, such as a fillet too large, blocks
  nothing. Later features build on the unchanged body.
- A consumed face errors its feature; the edit dialog repairs it. See
  [FEATURE_TIMELINE.md](FEATURE_TIMELINE.md).

## Regeneration

`DocumentEngine` in `server/src/geometry/engine.ts`.

1. Features evaluate in timeline order. Each sees only the state before it.
2. Each feature stores a snapshot keyed by `featureKey`, and by that key with
   its reported `targets` when it had none.
3. The longest unchanged prefix is reused, so an edit to feature _k_
   re-evaluates _k..end_.
4. The marker truncates evaluation; later features report `rolledBack`.
   `shouldStop` cancels between features and inside kernel calls, and the
   next run resumes at the first `cancelled`.
5. A failing feature records `error` and evaluation continues from the state
   before it.
6. Suppressed features skip evaluation but keep their snapshot slot.
7. A changed `namingVersion` drops the cached timeline.

## Feature guards

A kernel success is not trusted. Each guard errors and keeps the previous
body.

- Cut tool operations, Combine cuts, Press/Pull cuts and Shell hollow cuts
  run through `checkedCut` in `server/src/geometry/boolean.ts`.
- Every join ends in `finishJoin` in `server/src/geometry/booleanNaming.ts`.
  Two guards warn instead: zero-thickness detection in
  `server/src/geometry/joinCheck.ts` and contact-only joins in
  `server/src/geometry/boolean.ts`. A join, or
  an extrude, revolve, sweep, loft or emboss cut, that leaves a zero-thickness
  edge its inputs lacked builds, and the feature status is `warning` naming
  the edge length. A join tool that touches a body only along an edge or at a
  vertex stays a separate body, and the status is `warning` saying so.
- Extrude, revolve, sweep and loft bodies of every operation, and Combine
  results, pass `rejectInvalidBody` in `server/src/geometry/featureState.ts`
  on the final shape, after `unifyTool`. `invalidPart` first rejects a slit
  face, whose boundary runs out along an edge and back, from topology alone;
  seam edges of periodic faces are exempt.
- Fillet and Chamfer check validity, shell count, cut-through, run-past ends
  and loose tolerances (`cutsThrough`, `looseBlend`).
- Shell stores an optional `body` (schema 24). With no open faces it hollows
  that body, else the first body; open faces must lie on the chosen body.
- Shell stores `direction` (schema 26): `inside` and `outside` use
  `thickness`; `both` uses `thickness` inside and `outsideThickness` outside,
  which exists only for `both`. Earlier shells migrate to `inside`.
- Shell builds each side alone and fuses inside with outside for `both`. A
  closed side cuts the body from its offset solid; an open side uses the
  kernel's thick solid with arc joins, so outer edges round at the wall
  thickness. An inside opening falls back to the inner offset joined to a slab
  over each opened inner face: a prism for a flat face, thickening for a
  rounded one.
- Every candidate qualifies before it replaces the body: valid, the same solid
  count, a hollow for inside walls, and a probe at half the wall depth behind
  each face, empty under an opened face and solid under a kept one. The
  filleted-cube cylinder opening that once kept its wall now reaches the
  fallback and qualifies. A refused, partial or unqualified result keeps the
  previous body and names the size and the reason.
- Tangent chains: `server/src/geometry/tangentEdges.ts`.
- Mesh imports cap at `MAX_MESH_TRIANGLES` in
  `server/src/geometry/importers.ts`.

## Move

`evalMove` in `server/src/geometry/move.ts`.

- Move turns its bodies `angle` degrees about `axis`, then translates them.
  `axis` is an origin axis, a straight edge or a sketch line, as Revolve and
  Circular Pattern store it.
- Schema 29 adds `axis`, `angle` and `copy`. An earlier Move migrates to the Z
  axis, angle 0 and no copy, so it loads as translation only.
- Without `copy`, each body keeps its id and face names. Sketches drawn on
  it, or used by the feature that made it, move with it.
- With `copy`, the originals stay put and each moved body is a new body,
  named in `bodyMeta` like any other. One add is one undo step.
- An axis edge or line that no longer resolves errors the feature and keeps
  the bodies.

## Fillet and chamfer picks

`blendEdges` in `server/src/geometry/blendEdges.ts`.

- Schema 32 adds optional `faces` (face references) and `features` (feature
  ids) to Fillet and Chamfer, and `edges` may be empty when either has an
  entry. A blend with no pick is refused: "needs an edge, a face or a
  feature". An earlier document migrates unchanged.
- The picks are stored, never the edges they stand for. Each evaluation
  derives the edges: explicit edges, then each face's sharp boundary edges,
  then the sharp edges of every face a feature made (`faceMadeBy` in
  `shared/src/topoRefs.ts`: names starting `f:{id}:`, `m:{id}:` or
  `p{n}:{id}:`), each set in `compareNames` order. An edge picked twice
  blends once, at its first place. An upstream edit that adds edges to a
  picked face adds them to the blend.
- Sharp means the two faces fold by 1 degree or more; a seam or a tangent
  join is not sharp. `sharpEdgesByFace` in
  `server/src/geometry/tangentEdges.ts` owns the test, which the tangent
  chain shares. Tangent chain applies to derived edges.
- A face pick resolves, signs and repairs like any face reference. A feature
  pick is a feature input, so the blend blocks with that feature.
- A face or feature with no sharp edges errors the blend and keeps the body:
  "Fillet found no sharp edges on face {name}" or "Fillet found no sharp
  edges on the faces of feature {id}", with Chamfer for a chamfer.
- An edge-only blend passes its stored `edges` through unchanged. The size
  hint estimates from the derived edges.

## Fillet types

`moduleFillet` in `server/src/geometry/filletRoute.ts`.

- Schema 33 adds `filletType`: `equalDistance` or `twoDistances`. An earlier
  fillet migrates to `equalDistance` and builds as before.
- `twoDistances` stores `distance2` and `flip`. `radius` is distance 1 and
  lies on the measured face, chosen as Chamfer chooses it; `distance2` lies on
  the other face. Equal distances build today's fillet.
- Two distances build our own elliptical strip (`ellipticStrip.ts`), tangent
  to both faces: the image of today's round fillet under the shear that keeps
  each face and scales its tangent distance to distance 1 and distance 2. At
  90 degrees it is a quarter ellipse with semi-axes distance 1 and distance 2.
  The strip is an extruded exact ellipse, trimmed and sewn like KERN-034's
  round strips, with exact ellipse ends on end faces.
- Every picked or derived edge must be straight with flat faces at it and at
  its ends, else "two-distance fillet works on straight edges between flat
  faces". Two picked edges meeting at a corner mitre; three refuse. An edge
  with a collinear neighbour refuses, picked or not.

## Fillet sets

`evalFillet` in `server/src/geometry/blend.ts`; `filletSets` and
`withFilletSets` in `shared/src/features/fillet.ts`.

- Schema 34 adds optional `sets`: each holds `edges`, optional `faces` and
  `features`, and a `radius`. The fillet's own picks and `radius` are set 1,
  so an earlier fillet loads as one set and the migration only bumps the
  version. A binding on `/radius` stays on set 1; set 2 binds
  `/sets/0/radius`.
- Each set derives its edges as a blend does. An edge in two sets takes the
  radius of the first, and a tangent chain follows the radius of the set it
  grew from, again first set first.
- Sets of one radius build as one set holding every edge, through today's
  route. Different radii build in one kernel fillet with a radius per edge,
  so sets meeting at a vertex share a corner. It passes the same validity
  checks as any fillet.
- `sets` exists with any non-empty pick per set, and only for
  `equalDistance` once it has an entry. An empty list is one set; the dialog
  sends it to clear stored sets.
- The dialog keeps the active set in its params. The size hint sends the
  draft with the active set first, so the search sizes that set's radius on
  its edges while the others keep theirs.

## Rule fillet

`blendEdges` in `server/src/geometry/blendEdges.ts`.

- Schema 35 adds optional `betweenFaces` and `betweenFeatures` to a fillet
  and to each set: Fusion's Rule fillet, Between faces/features. Fusion's
  All edges is the plain face and feature pick.
- With either one holding an entry, the set's face and feature picks round
  only the sharp edges between one of their faces and one of the between
  faces, a feature's between faces being those it made. Picked edges still
  round as picked. A rule with no face or feature pick to start from errors,
  "a rule fillet needs a face or a feature to round from", and a rule that
  finds no such edge errors, "Fillet found no sharp edges between the picked
  faces". An earlier document migrates unchanged.
- Between picks resolve, sign and repair like the set's own picks, under
  `/betweenFaces` and `/betweenFeatures` of their set.

## Variable radius

`moduleFillet` in `server/src/geometry/filletRoute.ts`, else `nativeFillet`
in `server/src/geometry/nativeFillet.ts`.

- Schema 35 adds `filletType` `variableRadius` with `endRadius`. `radius`
  holds at the start of each edge's curve, or of the tangent chain it grows,
  and `endRadius` at its end. Swapping the two values reverses it. It takes
  one set and no size hint.
- Straight edges between flat faces, with flat faces at their ends, no
  collinear neighbour and no shared corner, build our own exact cone
  (`conicStrip.ts`): the envelope of balls tangent to both faces whose
  radius runs from `radius` to `endRadius`. The blend module gives the ball
  centre and contacts at each end; the cone's axis runs through both
  centres and its contact lines lie in the faces. Equal radii and every
  other edge build through OCCT's two-radius edge,
  `BRepFilletAPI_MakeFillet::Add(R1, R2, E)`, an approximation. The cone's
  radius is linear along the edge; OCCT's is not linear between the ends.
- Radii at more than two points need OCCT's radius-at-parameter form
  (`Add(UandR, E)`), whose array type the pinned build does not bind
  (KERN-045).

## Chamfer

`evalChamfer` in `server/src/geometry/blend.ts`.

- Schema 30 adds `chamferType`: `equalDistance`, `twoDistances` or
  `distanceAngle`. An earlier chamfer migrates to `equalDistance`.
- `equalDistance` sets `distance` on both faces and keeps its route: the
  kernel module for plane-plane and plane-cylinder edges, else OCCT, else the
  planar envelope.
- `twoDistances` stores `distance2` and `flip`; `distanceAngle` stores
  `angle` (above 0 and below 90 degrees) and `flip`. Both build only through
  `BRepFilletAPI_MakeChamfer`: `distance` lies on the measured face, and
  `distance2`, or `distance` times the tangent of `angle`, on the other.
- The measured face of an edge is a picked face when one of its two faces
  is; otherwise the one bounded by more of the selected edges; on a tie it
  is the first face in the edge name,
  `e[{faceA}|{faceB}]`. `flip` measures on the other face, so it flips every
  edge of a selection. Face names and the selection are stable, so the
  choice survives re-evaluation. A tangent chain follows the measured face of
  its first edge (`chamferContour.ts`).
- `shared/src/schema/chamferFields.ts` says which of `distance2`, `angle`
  and `flip` a fillet or chamfer type owns; an unknown type owns none. An
  edit that sets `filletType` or `chamferType` drops the fields the new type
  does not own (`dropUnownedBlendFields`).
  An edit that sends no bindings, a preview included, drops the feature's
  stored bindings whose path no longer holds a number (`bindingHolds`, used
  by `server/src/api/featureRoutes.ts`), so the staged document still
  evaluates; sent bindings are still refused when they do not resolve.
- A dialog keeps the bindings it opened with (`openingBindings` in
  `client/src/previewSession.ts`). At OK the saved bindings are that
  snapshot plus the dialog's own edits, filtered by `bindingHolds`, so a type
  round trip inside one session restores a dropped binding.
- The size hint covers `equalDistance` only.

## Tolerances

`shared/src/tolerance.ts` owns `LINEAR_TOL`, `ANGULAR_TOL_DEG` and
`UNIT_DOT_TOL`, one constant per quantity even where values match.
`MIN_OFFSET_MM` in `shared/src/features/sketch.ts` is an
input bound, not a tolerance.

## Sketches

- The solver is `shared/src/solver.ts`: `shared/test/solver.test.ts`.
- An `external` point is projected or linked geometry: its position is driven,
  never solved. A dimension's `labelOffset` is a sketch UV offset from its
  default anchor, for display only; the solver ignores it. A `distance` with
  `axis: null` measures directly, and `"x"` or `"y"` measures along that axis.
- A profile id hashes its bounding entity ids. `findProfile` in
  `shared/src/profiles.ts` still finds ids saved before tangent splitting
  (DEC-101): `shared/test/profiles.test.ts`.
- Region detection drops every piece with a free end, repeatedly, before it
  traces loops, so a dangling line neither enters nor splits a profile. An id
  whose saved loop ran into a spur resolves only when exactly one pruned
  profile has the same area and directed curves that all lie on that loop. A
  sketch without spurs resolves every id as it did before pruning:
  `shared/src/profiles.test.ts`.
- A planar face supports a sketch independently of its boundary curves.
  Automatic boundary import retains exact straight edges, circles, ellipses
  and their arcs. If any curve is unsupported, the sketch starts empty and reports that
  limit instead of importing a partial profile. Reference import classifies
  unsupported curves without sampling them; DXF export still samples them.
  Project can import supported edges individually; unsupported edges report
  their limit.
- Projections (`shared/src/projection.ts`) keep child ids `:a`, `:b` across
  regeneration. A missing source fails the sketch rather
  than keep stale points. A circle parallel to the sketch stays a circle or
  arc. A tilted circle or an ellipse projects to an exact ellipse with ids
  `:c`, `:m`, `:n`, plus `:a`, `:b` for an arc; an edge seen edge-on refuses.
  Edge signatures still record an elliptical edge as `other`.
- A sketch arc runs counter-clockwise from `start` to `end` about `center`.
  The solver holds both ends at one radius.
- `editSketchOffset` in `shared/src/sketchOffsets.ts` keeps generated entity
  ids: `shared/test/sketchOffsets.test.ts`.
- Trim (`shared/src/sketchTrim.ts`) and extend (`extendSketch` in
  `shared/src/sketchModify.ts`) keep unchanged endpoints:
  `shared/test/sketchModify.test.ts`.
- `editedEntities` in `shared/src/solver.ts` refuses a write whose added or
  changed constraints stop a converging sketch from converging, and names the
  first such constraint. Client and server both call it. A sketch already in
  conflict is not refused.
- Schema 25 adds the sketch `ellipse`: `center`, `major` and `minor` point ids,
  with the longer axis taken as major. The solver keeps the axes perpendicular
  as it keeps arc radii equal. Validation in `shared/src/features/sketch.ts`
  refuses zero or non-perpendicular axes. On the ellipse curve it accepts only
  `pointOnCircle` and `tangent` to a line, solved by `ellipseLevel` and
  `ellipseLineGap` in `shared/src/sketchCurves.ts`; other constraints refuse.
  A solve weakly holds the points of every ellipse not being dragged, so a new
  constraint moves the other curve rather than resizing the ellipse:
  `shared/test/ellipseConstraints.test.ts`. Schema 28 adds optional `start`
  and `end` points: an elliptical arc runs counter-clockwise from start to
  end, and the solver holds each end on the curve. A line splits an ellipse
  or elliptical arc at their exact intersections. Contact with a circle, arc
  or other ellipse forms no region and the sketch warns; profile ids saved
  earlier still resolve. Trim, extend, offset and sweep paths refuse
  ellipses. `pieceEdge` in `server/src/geometry/sketchEdges.ts` builds the
  exact `gp_Elips` edge between snapped ends: `shared/test/ellipse.test.ts`,
  `shared/test/ellipticalArc.test.ts`.
- The solver skips a dimension with `driven: true`. The field is optional, so
  sketches saved without it load unchanged with no schema step.
- `shared/src/solver.ts` minimises constraint residuals with
  Levenberg-Marquardt on a numeric Jacobian, the same code in the browser
  and on the server; degrees of freedom are variables minus Jacobian rank. A
  newly driving constraint whose rows raise no rank in their component is
  redundant and refused by name (`shared/src/solverRank.ts`); tools and trim
  drop such a relation they inferred.
- `shared/src/bspline.ts` holds B-spline data as the kernel's
  `Geom_BSplineCurve` does: degree, poles, optional weights, distinct knots,
  multiplicities and an optional periodic flag. `bsplineProblem` refuses what
  the kernel refuses, and an open spline must be clamped. A periodic curve
  repeats over its knot span, `last - first`, with its poles in the kernel's
  order. `dxfSplines` in `shared/src/importDxf.ts` reads SPLINE records
  into that form; a closed SPLINE whose last `degree` poles repeat its first
  becomes periodic. Fit-point-only, unclamped open and malformed records are
  skipped with a reason: `shared/test/spline.test.ts`.
- Schema 36 adds the sketch `spline`: `degree`, `poles` as point ids,
  optional `weights`, `knots`, `multiplicities` and optional `periodic`.
  Validation refuses what `bsplineProblem` refuses, and constraints on the
  curve itself; constraints on its poles stay. `importDxf` builds one from a
  SPLINE whose normal is Z, passing scale only to `sketchBuilder`. An open
  spline is clamped, so its end poles are its ends and share the points of
  touching curves; a periodic one closes on itself. Dragging a pole moves the
  curve through the generic point paths. Open splines join other curves at
  their ends to form regions, and an end pole may cut a line or arc. A
  periodic spline, or a clamped one whose end poles meet, closes alone like a
  circle, with no ends. A curve touching a spline off its ends removes the
  spline from regions and the sketch warns (`regionWarning` in
  `shared/src/curveLimits.ts`); trim refuses both curves. That contact test
  samples each knot span and refines the nearest gap; it is not an exact
  intersection. `pieceEdge` builds the exact `Geom_BSplineCurve` edge, so
  sides name after the spline and solids keep its exact data. Trim, extend,
  offset, dimensions, relations and sweep paths refuse it. DXF export samples
  it, since the R12 writer has no SPLINE entity: `shared/test/spline.test.ts`.

## Frame conventions

`server/src/geometry/frames.ts` owns sketch frames. Origin planes use
`ORIGIN_FRAMES`. A face frame's origin is the point on its plane closest to
the global origin, so a sketch rides its face. Construction plane methods:
`shared/src/features/constructionPlane.ts`. Placements:
`shared/src/placement.ts`, `shared/test/placement.test.ts`.

## Tessellation

`server/src/geometry/tessellate.ts` and `server/src/geometry/mesh.ts`. Every
face triangle range, edge polyline and vertex carries its persistent name, so
selection is topology, never a triangle index. The viewport and STL export
both mesh through `meshShape`. Export formats:
`server/src/geometry/exporters.ts`.

## Naming upgrade

`server/src/store/namingUpgrade.ts` moves a version 1 document to version 2
only when the user asks, after a `naming1-{hash}` backup of the complete
project. A browser project first keeps its version 1 record in this browser
as `<name> (before naming upgrade)`, and nothing commits if that copy fails
(`client/src/browserProjects.ts`). `planNamingUpgrade` in `server/src/geometry/upgradeNaming.ts` proves
a mapping by provenance only, never by an `x{n}` or `~n` name. The commit
refuses while a `candidate` or `ambiguous` mapping lacks a choice or a
feature fails only under version 2, and writes one save. After the save it remaps each user's hidden body ids through the
final-body mappings; a remap failure after the save is a `kept` error. Vertex references are not mapped. A version 1 copy name compares
by its version 2 form, each `m:` or `p{i}:` prefix applied as a key from
the inside out.

## Reference signatures

Feature add and update fill each missing `sig` from the state before the
feature and keep one sent with the reference. A reference sent without `sig`
keeps the one its name already had, so reference repair signs an accepted or
re-picked reference first (`ROUTES.refSignature`) and sends that `sig`.
`collectTopoRefs` in `shared/src/topoRefs.ts` derives face and edge paths
from `FeatureSpec.refs`.
The same contract owns body and feature dependencies, including references
inside planes, axes and points. Opaque extension parameters are not references
unless their registered spec declares them.

A save that changes a feature refreshes the stored `sig` of each reference
that still resolves on its name in every later feature the save left
unchanged, from the state before that feature, so a later renumbering is
still caught. A reference that no longer resolves, or whose body is blocked,
keeps its `sig`. Only features the save evaluates refresh; one past the
timeline marker refreshes when the timeline rolls forward over it. A preview
refreshes at commit. `refreshSigs` in `server/src/api/projectMutations.ts`
owns this and runs after the save's evaluation. Evaluation never writes `sig`.

## Tool targets

Extrude, revolve, sweep, loft and emboss may store `targets`. Stored targets
give the result the defaults gave. Add and update write them; hidden bodies
are never default participants; evaluation never reads the view:
`pinTargets` in `shared/src/topoRefs.ts`.

An empty `targets` makes a join a new body. On a cut or intersect it fails
the feature with `{operation} has no target body` and keeps every body. With
no `targets` and no body, every tool operation makes a new body; only a join
reports `[]`, so a cut or intersect never pins an empty list
(`applyToolOperation` in `server/src/geometry/boolean.ts`).

## Loft sections

Loft stores profile and planar-face references in picked order. Face sections
use their existing boundary, with one outline and no holes. Join includes
each selected source body before any explicit extra target, retaining the
first source body's identity. Profile-only lofts keep their existing target
behaviour.

Schema 22 adds mixed sections without changing existing profile references.
The fork migration chain remains authoritative. Upstream schema 12 documents
that have no naming version receive version 1 while retaining the fork's
view split. The project store backs up the complete previous project before
the first migrated save.

## Named parameters

Schema 23 adds `parameters` and `parameterBindings`, empty for prior documents.
Parameters retain name, unit, expression and comment; bindings retain a feature
id, schema-relative numeric path and expression. Stored feature inputs remain
numbers. `resolveDocumentParameters` in `shared/src/parameters.ts` owns derived
values and a resolved feature copy, without changing the stored associations.
Numeric schemas own binding eligibility, units and bounds. Names, references,
cycles, dimensions and numeric results are validated before document acceptance.
Model inputs retain associations; settings and export options calculate once.
Geometry resolves inputs before feature-cache keys. Project mutations compare
resolved sketch dimensions and use the existing write-time solver only for added
or changed constraints, retaining other stored positions and bound literals.
History restore keeps the snapshot's stored positions. Deleting a feature removes
its bindings; undo restores them. Parameter edits use the same revision, preview
and history owners as feature edits; rejected expressions and conflicting
dimensions leave the saved document and history unchanged.

`ExpressionField` in `client/src/components/form/expressionField.tsx` owns
every numeric field: it evaluates text with the shared parser and the
document's parameters, keeps bounds and stepping, and shows errors on the
field. A feature field names its binding path; text that uses a parameter
links, a constant calculates once, and a handle that sets a new value unlinks.
In a non-mm display unit a unitless linked result is stored with that unit.
`client/src/features/bindings.ts` saves a feature and its changed bindings as
one staged transaction, so one undo reverts both. Quick Edit fields link the
same way.

A sketch dimension links through the same field. A binding path names an array
index, so `movedBindings` in `shared/src/parameters.ts` moves a binding with the
item id it names and drops it when the item goes. `commitDraftSketch` sends the
moved bindings with the sketch edit; a driven dimension keeps no link. A sketch
opened for editing shows resolved dimension values.

Core feature schemas live in `shared/src/schema/coreFeatures.ts`, below the
parameter resolver and document validation. `schema/features.ts` retains their
public exports alongside the document schemas. The cached parser lives in
`schema/validation.ts` without document or feature imports.
