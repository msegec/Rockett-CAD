# Rockett CAD

Team Rockett!

Prepare for trouble!
And make it double!

To protect the world from devastation!
To unite all peoples within our nation!

To denounce the evils of truth and love!
To extend our reach to the stars above!

Team Rocket blasts off at the speed of light!
Surrender now, or prepare to fight!

Self-hosted, browser-based **parametric CAD** with a B-Rep kernel and a feature
timeline. The aim is Fusion features for design and manufacture workspaces: CNC
toolpaths, PCB and electrical plugins, from the model to a finished part.
Additive work is STL and 3MF export today, and can become a plugin later.

> **Sketch → constrain → feature → body → timeline → modify → regenerate → export**

Built on a real B-Rep solid-modelling kernel (OpenCascade / OCCT compiled to
WebAssembly), not a mesh editor. Every operation is an editable parametric
feature in a chronological timeline; editing an earlier feature rebuilds
everything downstream against persistent topology references.

## Features

### Sketch

- **Sketcher**: draw lines, rectangles, circles, arcs, polygons, slots, points and construction geometry.
- **Constraints and dimensions**: constrain shapes, drive them with editable dimensions and watch the remaining degrees of freedom.
- **Line angles**: a typed angle is kept; double-click a line to edit its length and angle.
- **Regions**: crossing and touching curves split a sketch into regions, such as the four corners around an inscribed circle.
- **Angle snap**: hold Shift to snap a line to 15 degree steps; press A to lock its angle.
- **Offsets**: offset a curve or chain, then change its distance later from the badge in the sketch.
- **Project, trim and extend**: link earlier model edges into a sketch, trim the highlighted piece of a curve (T), extend curves to boundaries.
- **Insert DXF and SVG**: bring DXF lines, arcs, circles and points, or SVG paths and shapes, into the open sketch as editable geometry.
- **Edit in place**: editing a sketch rolls the model back to it; Finish Sketch returns to the saved position.

### Model

- **Solid features**: extrude, revolve, sweep, loft, emboss and deboss from sketch profiles or planar faces.
- **Tool targets**: join, cut and intersect act on the bodies you choose, from the list or by click, or on Auto.
- **Modify**: fillet, chamfer, shell, combine, split, press/pull and move bodies; shell with no open face hollows the body.
- **Tangent chains**: fillet and chamfer pick smooth connected edges in one click, on one or several bodies.
- **Replicate**: mirror, rectangular pattern and circular pattern.
- **Construction**: offset planes and midplanes; sketch on any planar face.
- **Origin axes**: pick X, Y or Z in the model tree or at the origin as a revolve or pattern axis.
- **Drag handles**: every feature with a main value, from extrude distance to pattern spacing, has an arrow or arc to drag.
- **Reference images**: place PNG, JPEG or WebP images on planes and calibrate them to real size.
- **Feature timeline**: click to select bodies, rename, edit, quick edit, hover preview, suppress, delete, roll back, insert; broken references flagged, never guessed.
- **Reference repair**: in the feature's dialog, accept or choose a proposed face or edge for a broken reference, or re-pick it.
- **Naming upgrade**: from a version 1 project's timeline menu or feature dialog, review every reference mapping, choose uncertain ones, apply, and undo.

### Inspect

- **Measure**: distance, ΔXYZ, angle, radius, area and length between points, edges and faces.

### Files

- **Import**: start or extend a project from a STEP, IGES, BREP, STL, OBJ or 3MF file. Meshes are not parametric.
- **Export**: download binary STL or multi-body 3MF with named bodies and a quality setting.
- **Autosave**: every change saves to a readable JSON file that keeps the full feature history.
- **Edit conflicts**: a clashing or unsent change waits for reapply or discard, which clears undo; cancel reverts saved previews.

### Workspace

- **Viewport**: orbit, pan, zoom to cursor, named views, fit, ViewCube, orthographic or perspective.
- **Toolbar**: every tool shows an icon above its label; constraints show icons only; tooltips give the shortcut key.
- **Shortcuts**: single keys start tools; ? lists every keyboard and mouse control in a resizable panel that fills the window.
- **Undo and redo**: undo any edit, even inside a sketch, separately from the feature timeline; an unchanged OK adds nothing.
- **Tool panels**: open with the main number selected and list each pick to remove; Enter confirms, Escape reverts.
- **Pick fields**: each dialog pick input is a row; viewport and tree clicks fill only the active row.
- **Groups**: gather selected bodies or sketches into named, collapsible tree folders with Ctrl+G or right-click.
- **Tree selection**: Ctrl or Cmd+click adds bodies or sketches, Shift+click selects a range; right-click acts on all.
- **Live preview**: feature dialogs keep the model before the feature pickable and ghost only that feature's result, green added, red removed.
- **Right-click menus**: project rows, tree items, timeline chips and the viewport offer their actions, sketch selections their relations; right-drag still orbits.
- **Projects**: sort into folders; create, rename, move or delete by button, right-click or drag; unreadable ones show why.
- **Project files**: download a project as one `.rockett` file, or open one as a new project, keeping what it hides.
- **This browser**: keep a project in this browser instead of on the server; move it either way by Move to or drag.
- **Reload**: refreshing the page reopens the project you had open; Back returns to the list.
- **Errors**: stay visible until dismissed, and their text can be copied.
- **Version label**: the bottom-right corner shows the running build; hover for commit, version and schema.

[docs/user/guide.md](docs/user/guide.md) explains how to use each one.

## Quick start (Docker)

```bash
ROCKETT_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:8788 docker compose up -d
```

Then open http://localhost:8788. The server refuses to start without
`ROCKETT_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, the comma-separated browser origins allowed to
change projects; list the origin you browse to. All state lives in the
`rockett-cad_data` volume; DOCKER.md covers LAN access, running dev and prod
side by side, and promoting the image dev verified to prod.
The container runs as the unprivileged `rockett` user: `/app` is root-owned
and `/data` is the only path it writes.

For Unraid, see [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md) and the template in
`docker/unraid-rockett-cad.xml`.

## Running build

The bottom-right corner of the project list and the workspace shows the
running build: the image's `git describe` output, else `v<version> <commit>`,
else `v<version> dev`. Hover it for the full commit, version and schema.
`GET /api/health` returns the same fields.

A plain `docker compose up` records neither, so the label reads
`v<version> dev`. For a granular label, build with
`--build-arg ROCKETT_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse HEAD) --build-arg ROCKETT_DESCRIBE=$(git describe --tags --always --dirty)`.
[DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md) has the full Compose and `docker build` commands.

## Development

```bash
npm ci                 # .npmrc: install scripts off, exact pins on save
npm run prepare        # once per clone: husky sets core.hooksPath to .husky/_
export ROCKETT_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173
npm run dev            # server on :8788 + Vite client on :5173
npm test               # typecheck, then shared, server and client tests
npm run lint           # oxlint
npm run format:check   # Prettier
npm run lint:readme    # README feature items stay within 20 words
npm run lint:comments  # comment ratchet: no file may gain a comment
npm run lint:writing   # writing lint over tracked markdown
```

The last two need masterrulez cloned to `~/masterrulez`. See
[DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md).
